## PCB

High resolution photos can be found in the above table.

### Connector J04

As can be seen in the PCB photos, there are empty pads for a connector
labelled "J04" (not on some CR models). Most likely this is for
debugging using an interface such as JTAG.

Analyzation of the signals on the pins provided the following
information regarding signal types.

"GND" means signal ground, it has the same potential as the whole ground
plane on the PCBs. The minus pole of one battery is directly connected
to it. "Vcc 3.3V" means the 3.3V power supply of the calculator. It
seems to be present even if the calculator is off. "Floating" is a
signal with an undefined voltage level, this state is very likely for
inputs. "High" is a signal with almost 3.3V, but not a supply signal.
These signals are probably inputs with pull-up resistors (they can be
pulled-down with a large value resistor).

|  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|
| GND | 1 | 2 | GND |
| Vcc 3.3V | 3 | 4 | Square-wave: 112Hz, 99% duty-cycle, not present if the calc is off |
| High | 5 | 6 | Square-wave: 112Hz, 99% duty-cycle, not present if the calc is off |
| High | 7 | 8 | Square-wave: 112Hz, 99% duty-cycle, not present if the calc is off |
| Floating | 9 | 10 | Square-wave: 112Hz, 99% duty-cycle, not present if the calc is off |
| GND | 11 | 12 | Square-wave: 112Hz, 99% duty-cycle, not present if the calc is off |
| GND | 13 | 14 | GND |
| Floating | 15 | 16 | Floating |
| Floating | 17 | 18 | GND |
| Floating | 19 | 20 | Square-wave: 112Hz, 99% duty-cycle, not present if the calc is off |
| Floating | 21 | 22 | Square-wave: 112Hz, 99% duty-cycle, not present if the calc is off |
| Floating | 23 | 24 | RS232 Output (115'200,8,n,1) |
| Floating | 25 | 26 | RS232 Input |
| GND | 27 | 28 | GND |
| GND | 29 | 30 | GND |

**TODO:** Double-check the results and find out, what these signals
(Floating, High, Square-wave) really are. Maybe, there are common
interfaces as JTAG, I2C or whatever.

### Connector J01 - Dock connector

Pins currently known, probably there are more GPIOs accessible.
Somewhere there's SPI, too.

|                                         |                 |

| Vin                                     | pin 19 (medium) |
| GND                                     | pin 22 (long)   |

### UART

A serial adapter can be connected to the Tx/Rx/GND pins of the dock
connector (pin 1 is the one at the left-hand side, TI-Nspire upside
down, connector at the bottom). **Warning: only use TTL voltage levels,
never RS232 levels**.

The configuration of the terminal on the computer side should be:

|              |        |
|--------------|--------|
| Baud rate    | 115200 |
| Data         | 8 bit  |
| Parity       | none   |
| Stop         | 1 bit  |
| Flow control | none   |

While starting up, the calculator sends some logging information through
the interface. A log (including deletion and reprogramming the OS) can
be found
[here](http://hackspire.unsads.com/files/log-philippburch-serial-boot.txt)).

Different types of files can be send with the X-Modem protocol,
depending on the boot startup options chosen with the
<a href="/Operating_System#Startup_key_combinaisons" class="wikilink"
title="key combos">key combos</a>. Windows HyperTerminal or TeraTerm
strangely couldn't be used for the X-Modem transfer.
[lrzsz](http://www.ohse.de/uwe/software/lrzsz.html) is a better
alternative, which can be built on Windows with Cygwin.

`stty -F /dev/ttyS0 115200 -evenp -cstopb`
`cat < /dev/ttyS0`
`# Abort with Ctrl+C when the X-Modem transfer begins`
`` # The `cat` is used to show the startup logs during reboot ``
`./lsz -X boot2.img <> /dev/ttyS0 >&0; cat /dev/ttyS0`

### Power supply

You can use the TI-Nspire with an external power supply (5V to 6V)
instead of the batteries. Use pad P1, pin 8 or pin 19 for V+ and pad P2,
pin 5 or pin 22 for GND. It will boot, but print "Critical voltage
detected. Forcing shutdown." on RS232 and shutdown. It seems that the
battery voltage of measured using only 2 batteries. A workaround is to
use two resistors (100K work) to set the middle point at half voltage.

## Other

### Real-Time Clock

The clock is correctly emulated in the
<a href="/TI-84_Plus_Emulation" class="wikilink"
title="TI-84 Plus mode">TI-84 Plus mode</a> of the TI-Nspire. Although
the TI-Nspire OS doesn't display any clock as the TI-89 Titanium and the
TI-84 Plus do, the TI-Nspire keeps track of time when the TI-84 Plus
keypad is replaced by the TI-Nspire keypad, and then put back. We can be
quite sure there is
an[RTC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_clock) inside. It is also
interesting to mention the XML tags *dfmt* (date format) and *tfmt*
(time format) set to 1 in the factory settings
(*phoenix/syst/locales/en/settings/factory.zip/settings.xml* of the
<a href="/OS_upgrade_files#Compressed_file_system" class="wikilink"
title="compressed file system">compressed file system</a>) in the OS
file of both the TI-Nspire and the TI-Nspire CAS. These two parameters
don't appear in the system settings dialog of the TI-Nspire OS, as it is
the case for the tags *curr* and *unit* of *settings.xml*.

### MMU

The
[ARM926EJ-S](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0198e/Babfdfbh.html)
integrated [Memory Management
Unit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit) is enabled,
but seems to only be used to map NOR, RAM and peripherals in memory
space, and control the cache settings :
