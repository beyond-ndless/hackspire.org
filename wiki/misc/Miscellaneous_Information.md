## Texas Instruments development team

- According to his
  [blog](http://zbowling.com/blog/2007/03/13/ti-nspire/), Zac Bowling
  has been working at TI on the project.
- It appears that [Hydrix](http://hydrix.com/) has contributed to the
  project, according to comments on the HP mailing list *comp.sys.hp48*,
  and to now deleted threads on TI's official discussion group.
- CVS logs in some resource files of the TI-Nspire CAS Software reveal
  that employees from [LearningSoft](http://www.learningsoft.net/) are
  commiters.
- The development team [probably
  uses](http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=5921727#5921727)
  the Eclipse IDE and Macs :)

## Random notes

- **Phoenix** is Texas Instruments' project name of the TI-Nspire,
  hackers may see it here and there. The Computer Link Software code
  name is *Phoenix Connect*.
- Texas Instruments
  [might](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/page/pmuellr?entry=rubyconf_2007)
  include a Ruby interpreter in the TI-Nspire in the future.
